# Agent Guidance

## Project Scope

This repository is the public source for Unicorn Solar Server: a Flask/Vite
service that displays solar battery, power-flow, and tariff state on a Pimoroni
Unicorn HAT Mini.

The project is derived from `aspaviento/unicorn-busy-server` and reuses the
Flask/Vite structure and Unicorn hardware wrapper while replacing busy-light
behavior with a solar display and solar-focused API.

## Repository Layout

- `server.py`: Flask API and display behavior.
- `lib/unicorn_wrapper.py`: hardware and dummy display wrapper.
- `test_server.py`: backend unit tests.
- `frontend/`: Vite/React control panel.
- `docs/`: public integration documentation.
- `install.sh`, `start.sh`, `unicorn-solar.service`: public install and service
  assets.

## Local Validation

Use the project README as the primary source for setup. Before committing code
changes, run the relevant checks:

```bash
python3 -m venv --system-site-packages .venv
.venv/bin/pip install flask flask-cors jsmin
.venv/bin/python -m unittest -v
```

For frontend changes:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run build
```

## Operating Rules

- Keep this repository public-safe. Do not add private hostnames, private paths,
  tokens, cron entries, local network details, or home deployment notes.
- Do not assume the service is currently deployed or running anywhere. Verify
  live deployment state outside this public repository before operational work.
- Keep private operation notes in a private location outside this repo.
- Preserve the public service identity documented here: `unicorn-solar.service`
  and default HTTP port `9001`.
- Only one Unicorn HAT Mini service should control the hardware at a time; keep
  service-conflict behavior explicit when changing install or systemd files.
- The native display target is a 17x7 Unicorn HAT Mini layout. Do not silently
  change dimensions, rotation, or display assumptions.
- Keep `/api/standby` distinct from `/api/off`: standby is the visible dim clock
  mode for intentional quiet periods, while off should turn off every pixel.
- User-facing frontend labels and descriptions belong in
  `frontend/src/content.ts`.

## Change Expectations

- Keep API changes backward-compatible unless the user explicitly asks for a
  breaking change.
- Update README or public docs when public API, install behavior, or display
  behavior changes.
- For deployment-sensitive changes, propose and validate locally first; do not
  restart remote services or change private cron jobs from this repo context
  without explicit live-operation instructions.
