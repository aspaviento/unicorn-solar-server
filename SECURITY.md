# Security policy

## Supported versions

Security fixes target the latest published release of Unicorn Solar Server.
At publication of this policy, that release is **v1.2.0**. Older releases,
including v1.0.0, do not receive separate security backports. Reports affecting
development code are also welcome, but unreleased commits are not a supported
release. Please reproduce against the latest release where practical.

This is a community-maintained project. Response and remediation times depend
on maintainer availability; no response deadline or support SLA is promised.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting form:

[Report a vulnerability privately](https://github.com/aspaviento/unicorn-solar-server/security/advisories/new)

You can also find it under **Security and quality → Advisories → Report a
vulnerability**. Do not open a public issue containing exploit details,
credentials, private addresses, or household configuration.

Include the affected version or commit, relevant installation details,
reproduction steps, expected and observed behavior, and potential impact.
Use synthetic examples and redact tokens, personal information, and private
network details. Coordinate disclosure with the maintainer while the report
is assessed. Report ordinary bugs and feature requests through public issues.

## Deployment expectations

The service is intended for a trusted local environment. Its web panel and
HTTP API can change the physical display and persistent configuration; the
application does not provide built-in authentication, authorization, or TLS.
Do not expose it directly to the public internet or grant untrusted clients
access. Use appropriate network access controls and, when needed, an
access-controlled reverse proxy.

Keep cloud credentials and real provider payloads in private configuration
outside the source repository. Generic examples and dummy mode are intended
for development and demonstration; they are not a security boundary.
